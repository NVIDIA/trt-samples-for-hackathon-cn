# Fill Layer

+ Random seed is not supported yet in TensorRT.

## Case Linspace

+ Produce a layer with linear space with initinalization and stride value.

## Case Random Normal

+ Produce a layer with normal distribution with mean and standard-deviation value.

## Case Random Uniform()

+ Produce a layer with uniform distribution with minimum and maximum value.

## Case To-Type

+ Modify output data type of the layer.

## Case Shape Input

+ Decide output shape of the layer at runtime by using shape input tensor.

## Case Shape Runtime

+ Decide output shape of the layer at runtime by output tensor from a prior layer.
