# Layer

+ Information of the layers are listed in [**Operators Document**](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/operators/docs/), here we just provide some more examples.

## Steps to run examples

+ `main.py` contains the common APIs for all layers.

+ all scripts `*Layer/*.py` are independently executable, reference output are listed in `*Layer/result-*.log

+ To run all tests in one time, use command below.

```shell
python3 testAllLayer.py
```

## TODO

+ Add information of deprecated APIs, argument constrain, argument default value
