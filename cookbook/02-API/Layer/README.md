# Layer

+ Information of the layers are listed in [**Operators Document**](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/operators/docs/), here we just provide some more examples.

+ Steps to run examples

+ `main.py` contains the common APIs for all layers.

```bash
python3 testAllLayer.py
```

+ All scripts `*/main.py` are independently executable, we can go into the directory and follow the README.md inside.

## TODO

+ Add information of argument constrain, argument default value, deprecated APIs.
