NOTE: The 'nvprof' command is intended to help nvprof users transition to nsys. Many nvprof
switches are not supported by nsys. The full nvprof documentation can be found at
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/profiler-users-guide. The nvprof transition guide for Nsight
Compute can be found at https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightComputeCli/index.html#nvprof-guide.
