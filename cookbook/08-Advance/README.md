# 08-Advance

+ Tool combinations of using TensorRT and other CUDA / pyTorch features.

## C++ Static Compilation

+ Static compilation the TensorRT engine into a executable file.

## CUDA graph

+ Use CUDA graph to solve launch bound issue (usually appear in small TensorRT engines).

## Use PluginV2DynamicExt

+ Data type and data format supported in TensorRT.

## Empty Tensor

+ Use case of empty tensors.

## Multi Context

+ Use multiple execution context to do inference.

## Multi Optimization Profile

+ Use multiple Optimization-Profile to do inference.

## Multi-Stream

+ Use one execution context with multiple CUDA stream.

## Stream and Async

+ Use customeized CUDA stream to do asynchronized inference.

## Subgraph

+ Use cases of parsing ONNX file with subgraph into TensorRT.
