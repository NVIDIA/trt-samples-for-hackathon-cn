  --maxBatch                  Set max batch size and build an implicit batch engine (default = same size as --batch)
                              This option should not be used when the input model is ONNX or when dynamic shapes are provided.
  --minShapes=spec            Build with dynamic shapes using a profile with the min shapes provided

                              Note: All three of min, opt and max shapes must be supplied.
                                    However, if only opt shapes is supplied then it will be expanded so
                                    that min shapes and max shapes are set to the same values as opt shapes.
                                    Input names can be wrapped with escaped single quotes (ex: \'Input:0\').
                              Example input shapes spec: input0:1x3x256x256,input1:1x3x128x128
                              Each input shape is supplied as a key-value pair where key is the input name and
                              value is the dimensions (including the batch dimension) to be used for that input.
                              Each key-value pair has the key and value separated using a colon (:).

                                    inputs following the same order as network inputs ID (even if only one input
                                    needs specifying IO format) or set the type and format once for broadcasting.
  --outputIOFormats=spec      Type and format of each of the output tensors (default = all outputs in fp32:chw)
                              Note: If this option is specified, please set comma-separated types and formats for all
                                    outputs following the same order as network outputs ID (even if only one output
                                    needs specifying IO format) or set the type and format once for broadcasting.

                              Each input shape is supplied as a key-value pair where key is the input name and
                              value is the dimensions (including the batch dimension) to be used for that input.
                              Each key-value pair has the key and value separated using a colon (:).

=== Build and Inference Batch Options ===
                              When using implicit batch, the max batch size of the engine, if not given, 
                              is set to the inference batch size;
                              when using explicit batch, if shapes are specified only for inference, they 
                              will be used also as min/opt/max in the build profile; if shapes are 
                              specified only for the build, the opt shapes will be used also for inference;
                              if both are specified, they must be compatible; and if explicit batch is 
                              enabled but neither is specified, the model must provide complete static
                              dimensions, including batch size, for all inputs
                              Using ONNX models automatically forces explicit batch.
