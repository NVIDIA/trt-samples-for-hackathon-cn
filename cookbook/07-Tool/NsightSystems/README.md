# Nsight Systems

+ Program performance analysis tool (replacing the old performance analysis tools nvprof and nvvp).

+ Related links
  + [CUDA Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone), which contains Nsight Systems (`/usr/local/cuda/bin/nsys*` after installation).
  + [Stand-alone Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems), suitable for updating Nsight Systems.
  + [Document](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/index.html).

+ Note: please update nsight systems to the latest version since output file generated by newer version is not supported in old version.

+ Suggestions for using Nsight Systems in model development in TensorRT:
  + Use the switch *ProfilingVerbosity* while building serialized network so that we can get more information about the layer of the model in the timeline of Nsight Systems (see 02-API/ProfilingVerbosity).
  + Only analyze phase of inference, not phase of building.

+ Steps to run this example

```bash
./main.sh
```

+ USe `nsys-ui` (in host device with UI) to read the output file `*.qdrep` or `*.nsys-rep`.

```bash
/usr/local/cuda/Nsight*/bin/nsys-ui
```
