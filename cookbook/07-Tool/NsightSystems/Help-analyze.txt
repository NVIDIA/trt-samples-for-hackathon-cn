usage: nsys analyze [<args>] <input-file>

<input-file> : Read data from a .nsys-rep or exported .sqlite file.

	-f, --format <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>

           Specify the output format. The special name "." indicates the
           default format for the given output.

           The default format for console is:    column
           The default format for files is:      csv
           The default format for processes is:  csv

           Available formats (and file extensions):

             column     Human readable columns (.txt)
             table      Human readable table (.txt)
             csv        Comma Separated Values (.csv)
             tsv        Tab Separated Values (.tsv)
             json       JavaScript Object Notation (.json)
             hdoc       HTML5 document with <table> (.html)
             htable     Raw HTML <table> (.html)

           This option may be used multiple times. Multiple formats may also
           be specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified format (and args)
           will be repeated to fill in the blanks. If the list starts with a
           comma, creating an initial blank format, the default will be
           substituted.

	--filter-nvtx  <nvtx_range_name>[@<domain_name>][/<index>]

           Filter the events and data records used to generate reports by
           the time range defined by the first instance of the given NVTX
           range. Only events or records that overlap with any of the given
           NVTX range are used to compile and calculate the report. Note
           that an event or data record can start before or end after the
           given NVTX range, as long as it exists at some point during the
           specified NVTX range.

           The domain name is not optional, and can only be excluded if
           the range was not assigned to a domain; if the range has a
           domain it must be given.

           By default, the first instance of the given NVTX range (as
           defined by the start time) is used to define the time range. A
           different instance of the given NVTX range can be used by
           specifying an index number.  The index is zero-based, so the first
           instance has an index of "0". If the characters after the final
           slash do not represent a positive integer, it is assumed they
           are part of the range/domain name.

           If used in conjunction with the --filter-time option, this option
           will override any explicit time values.

	--filter-time  [<start_time>]/[<end_time>]

           Filter the events and data records used to generate reports by
           the given time range. Only events or records that overlap with
           any of the given time range are used to compile and calculate
           the report. Note that an event or data record can start before
           or end after the given time range, as long as it exists at some
           point during the specified time range.

           Times are defined in nanoseconds. At least one time value is
           required. Any omitted time value will default to the minimum or
           maximum value (approximately +/- 290 years from the zero-point).
           The start time must be less than or equal to the end time.

           The time values are a series of integer or floating-point values
           followed by an optional unit. If no unit is given, the number is
           assumed to be in nanoseconds. Positive and negative values are
           supported, as well as scientific "e" notation. More than one
           value/unit can be given as long as there are no spaces. The
           units do not need to be given in any order and can even repeat.

           The following units are understood:

              ns, nsec : nanosecond
              us, usec : microsecond
              ms, msec : millisecond
              s, sec   : second
              m, min   : minute (60 seconds)
              h, hour  : hour (3600 seconds)

           For example, the value "1s2ms3us4ns" would indicate 1,002,003,004
           nanoseconds. "2ns5us2" would be 5004 nanoseconds (2 nanoseconds
           plus 5 microseconds plus 2 nanoseconds). A floating-point value
           is converted as a 64-bit "double" and is subject to the precision
           limitations of that format.

           If used in conjunction with the --filter-nvtx option, the
           --filter-nvtx option will take precedence.

	--force-export [true|false]

           Force a re-export of the SQLite file from the specified .nsys-rep file,
           even if an SQLite file already exists.

	--force-overwrite [true|false]

           Overwrite any existing output file(s).

	-h, --help=[<tag>]

	   Print the command's help menu. The switch can take one optional
	   argument that will be used as a tag. If a tag is provided, only options
	   relevant to the tag will be printed.
	   The available help menu tags for this command are:

	   export, format, help, nvtx, output, rule, rules, sql, sqlite, stats,
	   status, time, and units.

	--help-formats [<format_name>|ALL]

           With no argument, list a summary of the available output formats.
           If a format name is given, a more detailed explanation of the
           the format is displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a more detailed
           explanation of all available formats is displayed.

	--help-rules [<rule_name>|ALL]

           With no argument, list a summary of available rules. If a rule
           name is given, a more detailed explanation of the rule is
           displayed. If 'ALL' is given, a more detailed explanation of
           all available rules is displayed.

	-o, --output <output>

           Specify the output mechanism. There are three output mechanisms:
           print to console, output to file, or output to command. If no
           outputs are designated, the default is to print rules to the
           console.

           This option may be used multiple times. Multiple outputs may also
           be specified using a comma-separated list. If a list item is left
           blank by using repeating commas, the last specified output will be
           repeated to fill in the blanks. If the list starts with a comma,
           creating an initial blank output, the default will be substituted.

           If the given output name is "-", the output will be displayed
           on the console. If the output name starts with "@", the output
           designates a command to run. The nsys command will be executed and
           the analysis output will be piped into the command. Any other output
           is assumed to be the base path and name for a file.

           If a file basename is given, the filename used will be:

              <basename>_<analysis&args>.<output_format>

           The default base (including path) is the name of the SQLite file
           (as derived from the input file or --sqlite option), minus the
           extension. The output "." can be used to indicate the analysis
           should be output to a file, and the default basename should be
           used. To write one or more analysis outputs to files using the
           default basename, use the option: "--output .".

           If the output starts with "@", the nsys command output is piped to
           the given command. The command is run, and the output
           is piped to the command's stdin (standard-input). The command's
           stdout and stderr remain attached to the console, so any output
           will be displayed directly to the console.

           Be aware there are some limitations in how the command string is
           parsed. No shell expansions (including *, ?, [], and ~) are
           supported. The command cannot be piped to another command, nor
           redirected to a file using shell syntax. The command and command
           arguments are split on whitespace, and no quotes (within the command
           syntax) are supported. For commands that require complex command
           line syntax, it is suggested that the command be put into a shell
           script file, and the script designated as the output command.

	-q, --quiet

           Only display errors.

	-r, --rule <name[:args...][,name[:args...]...]>

           Specify the rule(s) to generate, including any arguments. This
           option may be used multiple times. Multiple rules may also be
           specified using a comma-separated list.

           If no rules are given, the following will be used as the
           default rule set:

              cuda_memcpy_async
              cuda_memcpy_sync
              cuda_memset_sync
              cuda_api_sync
              gpu_gaps
              gpu_time_util
              dx12_mem_ops

           See --help-rules for more information on each rule.

	--sqlite <file.sqlite>

           Specify the SQLite export filename. If this file exists, it will
           be used. If this file doesn't exist (or if --force-export was given)
           this file will be created from the specified .nsys-rep file before
           processing. This option cannot be used if the specified input
           file is also an SQLite file.

	--timeunit <time unit>

           Set basic unit of time. The default is nanoseconds.
           Longest prefix matching is done on the following units:

              nsec nanoseconds usec microseconds msec milliseconds seconds

           Prefix matching means that, in addition to the full unit names,
           prefixes can be used to specify a time unit. For example, "sec" can
           be used to specify "seconds", "us" for "usec" (microseconds), or
           "milli" for "milliseconds". This is similar to passing a
           ":time=<unit>" argument to every formatter, although the formatter
           uses more strict naming conventions. See "nsys stats --help-formats
           column" for more detailed information on unit conversion.
