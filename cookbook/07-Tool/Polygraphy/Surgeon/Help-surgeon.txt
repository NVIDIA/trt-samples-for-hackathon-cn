Logging:
  Options related to logging and debug output

  -v, --verbose         Increase logging verbosity. Specify multiple times for
                        higher verbosity
  -q, --quiet           Decrease logging verbosity. Specify multiple times for
                        lower verbosity
  --verbosity VERBOSITY [VERBOSITY ...]
                        The logging verbosity to use. Takes precedence over
                        the `-v` and `-q` options, and unlike them, allows you
                        to control per-path verbosity. Verbosity values should
                        come from Polygraphy's logging verbosities defined in
                        the `Logger` class and are case-insensitive. For
                        example: `--verbosity INFO` or `--verbosity verbose`.
                        To specify per-path verbosity, use the format:
                        `<path>:<verbosity>`. For example: `--verbosity
                        backend/trt:INFO backend/trt/loader.py:VERBOSE`. Paths
                        should be relative to the `polygraphy/` directory. For
                        example, `polygraphy/backend` should be specified with
                        just `backend`. The most closely matching path is used
                        to determine verbosity. For example, with:
                        `--verbosity warning backend:info
                        backend/trt:verbose`, a file under
                        `polygraphy/comparator` would use `WARNING` verbosity,
                        one under `backend/onnx` would use `INFO`, and one
                        under `backend/trt` would use `VERBOSE`.
  --silent              Disable all output
  --log-format {timestamp,line-info,no-colors} [{timestamp,line-info,no-colors} ...]
                        Format for log messages: {{'timestamp': Include
                        timestamp, 'line-info': Include file and line number,
                        'no-colors': Disable colors}}
  --log-file LOG_FILE   Path to a file where Polygraphy logging output should
                        be written. This may not include logging output from
                        dependencies, like TensorRT or ONNX-Runtime.

Surgical Instruments:
  {extract,sanitize,insert,prune,weight-strip,weight-reconstruct}
    extract             Extract a subgraph from an ONNX model based on the
                        specified inputs and outputs.
    sanitize            Clean up, optimize, and/or change input shapes in an
                        ONNX model.
    insert              [EXPERIMENTAL] Insert a single node into an ONNX model
                        with the specified inputs and outputs. Any existing
                        subgraph between the inputs and outputs is replaced.
    prune               [EXPERIMENTAL] Prune the weights of a model to follow
                        a 2:4 structured sparsity pattern without regard for
                        accuracy. For every four weight values, two will be
                        set to zero.
    weight-strip        Strip weights from the provided ONNX model
    weight-reconstruct  Reconstruct proxy weights in the Stripped ONNX model
