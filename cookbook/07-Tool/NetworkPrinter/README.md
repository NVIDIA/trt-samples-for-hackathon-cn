# Network Printer

+ Print information of layers and tensors in the network.

+ This is NOT for printing information in the TensorRT engine, use Engine Inspector for this purpose.

+ In this example, we create a simple network and then print it.

+ For Python workflow

```shell
python3 main.py
```

+ For C++ workflow

```shell
make
./main.exe
```
